a couple of textures (bundled into folder Textures) are "lifted" from Skinner and Recount, without permission (credit Jnd and Elsia/Cryect, respectively).
the "Truncate" tag processing is "lifted" from LibDogTags3.0-90203, without permission (credit CKnight).

enthusiasts who "helped" me by subjecting my AFK characters to "World PvP" during my attempts to test cross-faction functionality:

	Gama - Level 70 Human Paladin <Servants of the Light> - Cennarion Circle
	(blueflagged, and what is it about this need on the part of some people to be dismissive?)

	Articis - Level 73 Draenei Death Knight <Shadows Embrace> - Cennarion Circle
	Tessaria - Level 55 Night Elf Priest - Cennarion Circle
	Vinbaidie - Level 66 Dwarf Death Knight <Naga Stole Our Loot> - Cennarion Circle
	Stornrock - Level 80 Dwarf Hunter <Onoir Aiseagtha> - Cennarion Circle
	(blueflagged, and it took all 4 of them to handle a single AFK 70 hunter... even my pet was on "defensive")

ganking AFK characters that are deliberately located out of everyone's way is bad enough. spouting some self-absorbed rationale is even worse. i am trying to help people here, and this stuff is just unnecessary (not to mention bad manners).
